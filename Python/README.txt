        » (404) dashboard.html is not showing story entries

    > Story is created and saved to the database
        » entries are saved and can be manually pulled up when searching via 'id'
            ‣ /madlibs/<int:id>

    > Tedious coding, so would prefer to find a way to refactor if possible

    > Simple app, could add more features like...
        » taking user_id (in session/logged in) to control who can/cannot edit the form
        » validations to the form inputs (ie. if an empty field/improper answer/etc.)
        » *would like to look into trying to implement a word randomizer for filling in inputs (to add some fun/unintented story outcomes)
        » maybe add more mad lib stories instead of just the one
